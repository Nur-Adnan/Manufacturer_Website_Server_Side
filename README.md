## Description:
It's a Mern-Stack website. Users can access a home page that displays the site's most recent products when they log in. In addition, the user has access to a product path and a button for accessing further items, so they can shop for what they need. It's possible to pay using a credit card. Logging onto the site as an administrator gives you access to all orders and goods. They have the ability to add and remove products. There is no need for them to guess who has paid.
